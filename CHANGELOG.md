## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1.x to v2.x

#### Configuration Changes
If you were using environment variables in v1.x:
```bash
# Old (still works with deprecation warning)
export TIMEOUT=600

# New (recommended)
export BREW_UPDATE_TIMEOUT=600
```

#### Script Behavior
- The script now validates all inputs by default
- Error handling is more strict (may catch issues that were previously ignored)
- Backup retention is now configurable (defaults to 5 backups instead of fixed)

#### New Configuration File
Create `~/.brew_update_config` to customize behavior:
```bash
# Example configuration
MAX_BACKUP_COUNT=10
EXCLUDED_FORMULAE="php@7.4 node@14"
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```
